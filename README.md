List of all blogs in one column, in order of upload. Each blog has
a title, picture, and a summary

Picture becomes the nav, with with title in it. Kinda like 
Spotify's design

Project page
Same as blog page

Goal index
Two columns, multiple rows
Block sections containing different types of goals
Daily goals, weekly goals, monthly, yearly goals are subsections of 
recurring goals. 
One off goals to be completed by a certain date.
To be sorted by date to be completed by.
Another section for completed goals, mirroring the uncompleted.
Each goal has a title, a date to be completed by, and a penalty 
and reward for completion or failure to complete.
Private goals can only be viewed by the person who posted them.
Completed goals get a tick, then they are moved to "Completed" section.

Goal page
Each goal has a title, details, deadlines, reward for completion,
and a penalty when time runs out. Point system for goals?
Login, sign up are self explanatory. Needs a forgotten password
page and such.
